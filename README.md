# Students-Enrollment-Management-System
> ---
This was my Programming Fundamentals Project in my freshman year. The project was Students Enrollment Management System in c++ that involves file handling(text files), dynamic arrays(one dimensional and two dimensional) and pointers. Functions were also covered in this project. This C++ project is a Student Enrollment System that allows users to enroll students in different courses, drop students from courses, and display information about enrolled students and courses. It utilizes dynamic memory allocation for efficient management of student enrollments and reads course information from an external file.

The keypoints of this project are: 
1. Dynamic memory allocation for managing student enrollments.
2. Reading course information from a file ("Courses.txt").
3. Enrolling and dropping students from courses.
4. Displaying information about enrolled students and courses.

File Structure
1. **Main Program:** [main.cpp](main.cpp)
2. **Input File:** [Courses.txt](Courses.txt)
